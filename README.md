# ATLIQ Hardware Sales Analysis Power BI Project

Harnessing the power of Microsoft Power BI and MySQL, this project dives deep into sales transactions, customer behaviors, product performance, and market dynamics.

By leveraging MySQL to access and manage extensive datasets, we perform comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data wrangling operations within Power BI. This meticulous process ensures data integrity and readiness for analysis.

The culmination of this project is a robust, interactive dashboard that delivers profound sales insights for Atliq Hardware. This dynamic tool empowers stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions, driving business growth and market competitiveness.
